CS230: Module Eight Journal 
     The Gaming Room was our client, and they wanted us to design software to support a game called Draw It or Lose It across different platforms like web, Android, and iOS. Their main requirements were that the software had to be scalable, efficient, and allow players to have a consistent experience no matter which device they used. I think I did a good job making sure the documentation was clear and organized, especially when it came to explaining the system architecture and how the different parts would interact. Going through the design document step-by-step really helped when it was time to think about the code because it forced me to plan everything out ahead of time instead of just jumping into development without a structure.
     If I could revise one part of my documents, I would probably spend more time improving the user interface section. I focused a lot on the back-end structure, but I could have put more thought into how the user would actually interact with the app. When interpreting the user’s needs, I made sure to keep in mind things like easy navigation, cross-platform compatibility, and fast response times because those directly impact the player’s experience. It’s important to prioritize the user’s needs because if the app isn’t intuitive or responsive, people simply won’t want to use it. In the future, I would approach designing software by putting even more focus on the user.
